RANCHER LOGS
To see logs, to go Rancher, click through to service and elipses menu lets you get to logs and also
get to a cli for the box

ENV VARS IN Rancher
 config params you need to set are here: https://github.com/BrandwatchLtd/audiences-platform/blob/master/docs/service-resolver.md

Add them in rancher as an environment variable called `JAVA_OPTS` so as an example:
`JAVA_OPTS=-DservicerResolver.hostname.mnemosyne=query-proxy.mnemosyne-dev`
Click upgrade and the first page you see have the environment variables on it.

LINTING
npx eslint PATH --fix

RANCHER
Docker was not pulling new images - luke used ansible to clear the image caches
on all the boxes.

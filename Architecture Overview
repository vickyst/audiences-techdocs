servers are in Byfleet
use Rancher to see boxes / services

there is a lets-encrypt-service
and virtual IP addresses (VIPS)
VX-LAN


USUAL REQUEST
HTTP -> load balancer (there are 3) -> audience client(FE) -> audience service(webapp / service entry point)

But can hit audience-service directly (e.g status cake)

SERVICES
Audiences-service = webapp ( all endpoints should be here, if you write a micro-service it should have an entry point here)
                    and also search logic for audience searches.
Audience-client = frontend
Audience-rest-api = just forwards it to audience-service (something for me?)
Followers-list-service = deals with info about followers lists, asking for metrics
Page-metadata =
Profile-service = twitter profiles service
Token-store-service = pool of tokens, can add tokens with this
Twitter-ads-service = exports to twitter ads etc


mongo-db-backup = nightly backup to hdfs
configuration-loader = load config on startup

INFRASTRUCTURE
Cassandra = store tweets, kafka formatted data.  key-value store
Consul = config database / store (this will move to spring cloud config (github) )
Memcached = FE sessions but this is going away
Rancher-monitor = checks rancher health and pings slack
Zookeeper = co-ordination layer

JANITOR
spotify-cg = garbage collects stopped containers in Docker
container-crontab = scans looking for cron label (which you can add to a container) and starts them according to that label

JOBS
firehose-producer = connects to GNIP with HTTP, sends the firehose in JSON, line seperated, sends to firehose kafka topic
  sends to  ---
  - decahose-archiver = which archives the tweets in AWS S3
  - GNIP mirror service = chunks it into tweets, retweets,
    which sends to  ---- another topic as avro
  - GNIP compliance producer   --
      -- tweet compliance  processor (these delete from cassandra / Mnemosyne)
      -- tweet user processor (as above)

GNIP injestion-service   - takes avro from GNIP mirror service and does profile extraction . also gets links and sends to CRAWLER. Adds metadata --->
    -- fires into a kafka topic with the metadata ALSO Mnemosyne reads from this directly
    CRAWLER gets metadata from links
GNIP-emotion-services  - adds emotion as above
GNIP-interest-injestion-service - to be consumed by Mnemosyne.
Follower-import-service - polls mongo for jobs and outputs them to KAFKA (finds followers of a given account)
Follower-import-assembler - reads topic from above and mongo and Mnemosyne

+ others (see in Rancher)

ALL ONTO A kafka topic that now has avro hydrated tweets with metadata, which is read by the ...

datastore-populator - reads from kafka, writes to Cassandra, nothing else




DATA
Cassandra and Mnemosyne = sidestores
Kafka = point of truth
Mongo =
Redis = for web cache
